Welcome to my humble code.

This is a text to speech synthesizer that works
with the internet so ensure that you have
internet connection firstly.

Secondly the files here are all imported in
the main file which is main.py. Make sure all
files are in the same location.

To run the code make sure that an email is
sent to the email ishaque.intercom@outlook.com
and ensure that it has a subject line. Wait
for a few seconds, possibly a minute, and
then run main.py. The current version does
not poll.

After you have done this, it will display
the entire NLP process being executed on the
email, and the output should be heard on a
speaker. So make sure that audio output works.
