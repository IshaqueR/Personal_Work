These files are used with the demo. I can't upload any large audio files from my project onto git. Hopefully if you see the project files, and the readme.txt, you'll be able to figure out how to perform synthesis.
Goodluck, I really enjoyed this project, but it could use a lot more refinement. Also, neural networks are a better option given more time.
